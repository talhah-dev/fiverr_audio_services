## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Tailwind CSS** (utility classes already used in markup)
- **Font Awesome** (icons like `fa-microphone`, `fa-bolt`, etc.)
- **AOS** (scroll animations via `data-aos` attributes)
- **Web3Forms** (serverless form handling, no backend required)

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1) Tailwind (choose one)

**CDN (quick start)**  
Add Tailwind CDN in `<head>` for quick prototyping. (Good for development; for production, prefer a compiled build.)

**CLI build (recommended)**
1. `npm init -y`
2. `npm i -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`
3. `npx tailwindcss init -p`
4. In `tailwind.config.js` set content:
   ```js
   module.exports = {
     content: ["./*.html", "./docs/**/*.js", "./docs/**/*.html"],
     theme: { extend: {} },
     plugins: [],
   }
